This file is responsible for generating the javascript libraries. To add 
a library, add lists of functions that are generated with a common parent function.
Generate the parent function, and generate the child functions via for loop.
For now, the program is invoked by using 

$python generateJSLib.py > ../js/lib/bootstrap.js

and can be changed to generate the html library by changing the bottom line to 

generateHtmlDotJs().

and calling 

$python generateJSLib.py > ../js/lib/html.js

For now, this is a little hacky, but it works well for extending libraries with ease.
The next iteration will have the files predetermined and the generator for each file
specified in separate files.
